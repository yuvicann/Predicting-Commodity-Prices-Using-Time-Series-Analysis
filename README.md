# Predicting-Commodity-Prices-Using-Time-Series-Analysis


The objective of this project is to develop a robust time series model that can predict future prices of key global commodities. ​

This prediction model will leverage historical price data, to forecast future price movements.​

In our implementation, we have predicted Fuel Price Index.​

We got our dataset from Kaggle.​

The dataset includes monthly prices and indexes for 53 commodities from 1992 to 2014, with 2005 as the reference year for indexes (value = 100). Key categories in the dataset include All Commodity, Food and Beverage, Food, Beverage and Fuel Energy. Each category is represented by its respective price index
